# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Project Objective:
 • Main goal: Accurately predict the possibility and stages of heart disease.
 • Utilizes three machine learning techniques: Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest Classifier.
 • Aims to enhance accuracy and efficiency in predicting heart disease.
 
Dataset and Attributes:
 • Dataset comprises 11 medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, and fasting sugar level.
 • These attributes are crucial for predicting the likelihood and severity of heart disease.
 
 Machine Learning Algorithms:
 • Three algorithms employed: Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest Classifier.
 
 Prediction and Cost Efficiency:
 • Predicts stages of heart disease, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.
